# oakberrywebsite
This is fully resposive landing page for a fruit bowl company that is made completely from scratch.
I fully designed the CSS and look of everything as well as implementing JS features in the NAV.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS

This is a complete website template, everything someone would need to start a project site. The nav has features that are responsive, making a hamburger menu. The specials are cute and transform when you hover over them. The parallax effects are fun and clean. I think it’s all vanilla CSS and JS. I could probably use this as a template for a free-lance client.

## Lessons Learned:
*written 8/15/22 The most prominent aspect that I garnered experience from and learned the most from is creating the style and feel of the website. I’m not a designer so fitting items into a page that looked appealing was difficult. Even though it feels fairly simple it’s a great milestone to look at and see how much I was able to do with so little. I enjoy the parallax effect a lot. To be honest this was a point when most of what I wrote was a learning experience.
